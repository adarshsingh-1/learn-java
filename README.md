This repository contains my Java practice programs, notes, and mini-projects.  
It is organized topic-wise, starting from basics and covering Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  

## Contents
- Basics (Hello World, syntax, input/output)
- Control Statements (if-else, loops, switch)
- Arrays and Strings
- Methods and Recursion
- Object-Oriented Programming (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)

## Goal
To prepare for practical exams while building a strong foundation in Java and maintaining a structured GitHub contribution history.
