File handling :
Streams are basically Abstract classes in Java
Streams - sequences of data
here data can be of two types:
1. Byte streams - used to handle binary data (images, audio files, etc.)
2. Character streams - used to handle text data (plain text files, etc.)

java implements these withon the class hierarchy:
1. InputStream and OutputStream - for byte streams
   - FileInputStream and FileOutputStream - for reading from and writing to files in byte format
   - BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream - for efficient reading and writing of bytes using a buffer
   - DataInputStream and DataOutputStream - for reading and writing primitive data types
2. Reader and Writer - for character streams
   - FileReader and FileWriter - for reading from and writing to files in character format
   - BufferedReader and BufferedWriter - for efficient reading and writing of characters using a buffer
   - PrintWriter - for writing formatted text to a file

I/O Exception Handling:
File handling operations can throw IOExceptions, so it's important to handle these exceptions using try-catch blocks or by declaring them in the method signature.
